🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster
based on various features such as age, gender, passenger class, and more. 
It is a classic machine learning classification problem that demonstrates 
data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation techniques.

🧠 Project Overview

The Titanic Survival Prediction project uses the historical Titanic dataset from Kaggle to predict survival outcomes. 
The goal is to build a model that can learn patterns from the data 
and accurately predict whether a passenger survived or not

📊 Dataset

The dataset can be found on Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
.
Key Columns:

PassengerId – Unique ID for each passenger

Pclass – Ticket class (1 = First, 2 = Second, 3 = Third)

Name – Passenger name

Sex – Gender

Age – Age in years

SibSp – Number of siblings/spouses aboard

Parch – Number of parents/children aboard

Ticket – Ticket number

Fare – Passenger fare

Cabin – Cabin numbers

Embarked – Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

Survived – Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)


⚙️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x

NumPy – numerical computation
